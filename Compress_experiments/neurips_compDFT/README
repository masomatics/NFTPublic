Usage:
1) Put make_compDFT_files.sh and  neurips_compDFT.tar.gz in the same directory. 
2) Edit "directory" variable in make_compDFT_files.sh so that "directory" is used to install the program files. 
3) run "sh make_compDFT_files.sh"
4) cd "directory". 
5) run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6) run "sh neurips_compDFT.sh"
7) Experimental results will be written in "Results/neurips_compDFT_tesult.txt"
